Hi! I just started learning Node.js after finishing my JavaScript courses this morning.

I watched a video that showed me the latest front-end roadmap,so Node.js is my next step.

Hopefully, I'll finish this course before my birthday!

Let's go!

Hi! I finished my Node.js course today.

It covered some basic concepts, core modules, and APIs.

But I did gain something from it.

I also know there is a framework called Express.js, which helps us use Node.js more efficiently.

Now, Iâ€™m moving on to the next technology!
